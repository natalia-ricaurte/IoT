# Sustainability Evaluation for IoT Devices

This undergraduate thesis project, developed by Juan Camilo Pacheco, Natalia Andrea Ricaurte, and Laura Valentina Lara, implements an interactive system for assessing the environmental sustainability of IoT systems, with a focus on the operational phase of devices.

Through a dashboard built with Python and Streamlit, the system evaluates the environmental impact of each IoT device by considering factors such as energy consumption, electronic waste generation, use of renewable energy, operational efficiency, and data processing (including edge computing).

The system allows users to assign custom weights to sustainability metrics using a flexible approach that combines qualitative criteria, alignment with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), and the AHP methodology to structure the recommended weights.

### Validation Rules
- All numeric fields must be positive numbers
- Percentages must be between 0 and 100
- Functionality must be between 1 and 10
- Time values must be within logical ranges (e.g., daily hours â‰¤ 24)
- Weights must be positive and final weight must be less than or equal to initial weight

## Understanding Results

### Normalization Scale
All metrics are normalized to a 0-10 scale where:
- 10 represents the best possible performance
- 0 represents the worst possible performance

### Color Coding in Results
Results are color-coded for easy interpretation:
- ðŸŸ¢ Green (8-10): High performance
- ðŸŸ¡ Yellow (5-7.99): Moderate performance
- ðŸ”´ Red (< 5): Low performance

### Global Index Calculation
The global sustainability index is calculated as:
1. Each metric is normalized to 0-10 scale
2. Normalized values are weighted according to the selected configuration
3. The global index is the weighted sum of all metrics
4. For multiple devices, the global index is the average of individual indices

### Metric Interpretation
All metrics follow the principle that higher values indicate better performance:
- Energy Consumption (EC): Higher values indicate better energy management
- Carbon Footprint (CF): Higher values indicate better carbon management
- Electronic Waste (EW): Higher values indicate better waste management
- Renewable Energy (RE): Higher values indicate better renewable energy usage
- Energy Efficiency (EE): Higher values indicate better efficiency
- Product Durability (PD): Higher values indicate better durability
- Recyclability (RC): Higher values indicate better recyclability
- Maintenance (MT): Higher values indicate better maintenance management

## Default Weights

### Recommended Weights
The system provides recommended weights based on a structured prioritization method that combines:
1. Alignment with Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)
2. Qualitative assessment of environmental impact

| Metric | Weight | Description |
|:-------|:-------|:------------|
| Energy Consumption (EC) | 0.3267 | Highest weight due to direct environmental impact |
| Carbon Footprint (CF) | 0.1992 | High weight for climate change impact |
| Renewable Energy (RE) | 0.1992 | High weight for sustainable energy use |
| Electronic Waste (EW) | 0.0811 | Medium weight for resource management |
| Energy Efficiency (EE) | 0.0811 | Medium weight for operational efficiency |
| Product Durability (PD) | 0.0477 | Lower weight for product lifecycle |
| Recyclability (RC) | 0.0477 | Lower weight for end-of-life management |
| Maintenance (MT) | 0.0174 | Lowest weight for operational aspects |

### Weight Calculation Method
The recommended weights were derived using:
1. A structured prioritization method based on environmental relevance
2. Saaty's pairwise comparison technique
3. Integration of SDG alignment and environmental impact assessment
4. Validation through consistency ratio (CR = 0.037, below the 0.10 threshold)

### Custom Weight Configuration

- Use the recommended weights
- Manually adjust weights (system will normalize to sum 1)

## Model Integrity Note

The system maintains all sustainability metrics as an integral set for the following reasons:

### Model Integrity
- The model is designed for holistic sustainability evaluation.
- Metrics are interrelated and complementary.
- Omitting metrics could lead to incomplete or biased assessments.

### Scientific Validity
- The AHP+SDG model was developed considering all metrics.
- Weights were calculated based on each metric's relative importance.
- The pairwise comparison matrix was built with all metrics in mind.

### Project Purpose
- The goal is to provide a complete sustainability evaluation.
- Allowing metric exclusion could encourage cherry-picking.
- This may result in less rigorous or biased assessments.

### Evaluation Consistency
- Keeping all metrics ensures consistent evaluation across devices.
- This enables fair and objective comparison.

### SDG Alignment
- The model aligns with the Sustainable Development Goals.
- Omitting metrics may prevent the evaluation from fully reflecting SDG impacts.
